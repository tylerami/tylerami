# Hello! I'm Tyler! 👋

In my 5th year of a dual-degree program in **Software Engineering and Business Administration** at **Ivey Business School, Western University**. With a history of building applications and driving innovative solutions, I am deeply passionate about creating borderless, internet-native commerce networks. Bitcoin, Lightning Network, and decentralized payment technologies are close to my heart, and I'm eager to continue my journey in this realm.

## 🚀 Current Projects & Experience

- **Founder, CEO, and CTO of [HotTakes Sports](http://hottakesapp.com)**: A free-to-play fantasy sports game built in Flutter, aiming to simplify sports gaming for beginners. Successfully pitched and secured seed investment, led a team for sports data integration, and engineered a robust prize fulfillment system.

- **2x Software Engineer Intern at [Block (formerly Square)](https://block.xyz)**: Enabled improvements in the company-wide feature flag infrastructure, facilitated custom inventory adjustment types, and significantly reduced API calls.

## 🌍 My Passion

I'm passionate about **borderless commerce** which has drawn me to technologies like **Bitcoin and the Lightning Network**.
